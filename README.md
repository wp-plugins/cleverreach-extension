## Frequently Asked Questions

#### Why would I use the API instead of the source code provided within my CleverReach account?
Using the API will allow you to push and pull data from CleverReach. 
This allows things like smooth form submission via Ajax and custom error handling.

#### Is it secure?
We heavily rely on the built in security tokens (nonces) which helps to protect against several types of attacks including CSRF.
Moreover no customer data is stored within your WordPress database.

#### How can I customize the sign-up form or the error messages?
Check the [Wiki](https://github.com/hofmannsven/cleverreach-extension/wiki) for further information.
